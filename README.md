# googlemybusiness-address-format
Function to format address array from GoogleMyBusiness API into Taiwanese address format

A basic function I wrote for a project where we needed to convert the address array from the Google My Business API to the correct format for Taiwan (Postcode+City+District+Street) - all other addresses format in the US style (Street + Suburb + City + State + Postcode)

Returns address as a string.
